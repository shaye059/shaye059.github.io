                        </a>
                        <p> This project developed an AI-based solution for monitoring bee health, with a focus on
                            distinguishing between bees and wasps and detecting varroa mites on bees. The initiative
                            addressed the environmental challenge of maintaining healthy bee populations, given the
                            detrimental impact of varroa mites.
                            <br><br>
                            A ResNet RS 350 model, fine-tuned on TensorFlow's bee_dataset, formed the core of this
                            system. The model's capabilities were twofold: it differentiated between bees and wasps in
                            images, and it identified varroa mites on bees. This distinction is crucial for beekeepers
                            and environmentalists for effective bee population management and health monitoring.
                            For deployment, the model was served using TensorFlow Serving within a Docker container,
                            ensuring scalability and efficiency. The system architecture included a user-friendly
                            frontend for image uploads and a backend server hosted on Cloud Run. This server managed
                            request preprocessing and model prediction interactions.

                        </a>
                        <p> Myself and two others built and trained a neural network that could classify songs into 10
                            different genres. As part of the project we tested a baseline which was trained on the basic
                            waveform amplitude of the audio file, and compared it to a model trained on 5 specifically
                            chosen features. Our baseline saw a 2x improvement over randomly guessing the genre and our
                            feature trained model saw a <strong>6x improvement</strong>, with accuracy around 64% on
                            average.
                            <br><br>
                            The neural network used was a <strong>multi-layer feed forward network</strong> that was
                            built using <strong>Keras</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Data was pulled from the
                            <strong> <a href="http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html" target='_blank'>GTZAN
                            </a></strong> dataset and was preprocessed into <strong>Excel</strong> using automated
                            Python
                            methods that we created. The entire project was written in a <strong>Jupyter Notebook
                            </strong>. More information about it is available
                            <a href="https://github.com/shaye059/ML-Music-Genre-Classification" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        </a>
                        <p>The goal of this project was to have two autonomous vehicles - a land based robot and an air
                            based drone - cooperate together autonomously to complete a task. The task chosen for our
                            demonstration was garbage collection but the system could easily be adapted to other tasks
                            such as cleaning up oil spills.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The system implemented a <strong>Mask R-CNN</strong> neural network that detected litter in
                            images. The image processing and path planning was done in <strong>Python</strong> with
                            <strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPY</strong>. Most hardware components and sensors
                            were programmed in <strong>C</strong>. The land based robot was powered by a
                            <strong>Linux</strong>
                            based RaspberryPi which also acted as an <strong>NGINX</strong> server for video streaming.
