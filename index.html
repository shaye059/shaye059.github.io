								<h2>Hey, that's me!</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I've worked on projects spanning many of the different sub-fields of Artificial
								Intelligence. These include <strong>Classical Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Natural
								Language Processing</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, and <strong>Robotics
							</strong>.

								Some of my personal projects have included a <strong>neural network</strong>
								that can predict a song's genre and a <strong>cooperative autonomous vehicle</strong>
								system for litter collection. These projects, as well as others, can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/shaye059" target="_blank">
								GitHub</a>. When I'm not building my own projects I love teaching others about
								engineering. I've taught classes and workshops on skills like coding and 3D printing to
								kids and adults. When I can, I also write blog articles for Towards Data Science. Check
								out my latest one: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/finding-seasonal-trends-in-
								time-series-data-with-python-ce10c37aa861" target="_blank"> Finding Seasonal Trends in
								Time-Series Data with Python</a>.

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;">Music Genre Classification with a Neural Network</h2>
						<p> Myself and two others built and trained a neural network that could classify songs into 10
							different genres. As part of the project we tested a baseline which was trained on the basic
							waveform amplitude of the audio file, and compared it to a model trained on 5 specifically
							chosen features. Our baseline saw a 2x improvement over randomly guessing the genre and our
							feature trained model saw a <strong>6x improvement</strong>, with accuracy around 64% on
							average.
							<br><br>
							The neural network used was a <strong>multi-layer feed forward network</strong> that was
							built using <strong>Keras</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Data was pulled from the
							<strong> <a href="http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html" target='_blank'>GTZAN
							</a></strong> dataset and was preprocessed into <strong>Excel</strong> using automated Python
							methods that we created. The entire project was written in a <strong>Jupyter Notebook
							</strong>. More information about it is available
							<a href="https://github.com/shaye059/ML-Music-Genre-Classification" target="_blank">here</a>.

						</p>

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;"> Cooperative Autonomous System </h2>
						<p>The goal of this project was to have two autonomous vehicles - a land based robot and an air
							based drone - cooperate together autonomously to complete a task. The task chosen for our
							demonstration was garbage collection but the system could easily be adapted to other tasks
							such as cleaning up oil spills.
						<br>
						<br>
							The system implemented a <strong>Mask R-CNN</strong> neural network that detected litter in
							images. The image processing and path planning was done in <strong>Python</strong> with
							<strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPY</strong>. Most hardware components and sensors
							were programmed in <strong>C</strong>. The land based robot was powered by a <strong>Linux</strong>
							based RaspberryPi which also acted as an <strong>NGINX</strong> server for video streaming.
							You can learn more about this project
