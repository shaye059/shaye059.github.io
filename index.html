								<h2>Hey, that's me!</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Here's what I've been up to:
							</p>
							<p>
								I've worked on several <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>autonomous
								vehicle</strong> projects. Some of my projects have included a <strong>neural network</strong>
								that can predict a song's genre and a <strong>cooperative autonomous vehicle</strong>
								system that includes an aerial drone and land robot working together to achieve a common
								goal. These projects, as well as some of the other cool stuff I've worked on, can be
								found on my <a href="https://github.com/shaye059" target="_blank">
								GitHub</a>. I've also taught engineering skills such as coding and 3D printing to kids
								and adults.

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;">Music Genre Classification with a Neural Network</h2>
						<p> Myself and two others built and trained a neural network that could classify songs into 10
							different genres. As part of the project we tested a baseline which was trained on the basic
							waveform amplitude of the audio file, and compared it to a model trained on 5 specifically
							chosen features. Our baseline saw a 2x improvement over randomly guessing the genre and our
							feature trained model saw a <strong>6x improvement</strong>, with accuracy around 64% on
							average.
							<br><br>
							The neural network used was a <strong>multi-layer feed forward network</strong> that was
							built using <strong>Keras</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Data was pulled from the
							<strong> <a href="http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html" target='_blank'>GTZAN
							</a></strong> dataset and was preprocessed into <strong>Excel</strong> using automated Python
							methods that we created. The entire project was written in a <strong>Jupyter Notebook
							</strong>. More information about it is available
							<a href="https://github.com/shaye059/ML-Music-Genre-Classification" target="_blank">here</a>.

						</p>

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;"> Cooperative Autonomous System </h2>
						<p>The goal of this project was to have two autonomous vehicles - a land based robot and an air
							based drone - cooperate together autonomously to complete a task. The task chosen for our
							demonstration was garbage collection but the system could easily be adapted to other tasks
							such as cleaning up oil spills.
						<br>
						<br>
							The system implemented a <strong>Mask R-CNN</strong> neural network that detected litter in
							images. The image processing and path planning was done in <strong>Python</strong> with
							<strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPY</strong>. Most hardware components and sensors
							were programmed in <strong>C</strong>. The land based robot was powered by a <strong>Linux</strong>
							based RaspberryPi which also acted as an <strong>NGINX</strong> server for video streaming.
