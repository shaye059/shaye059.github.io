								<h2>Hey, that's me!</h2>

							<p>
								Here's what I've been up to:
							</p>
							<p>
								I've worked on several artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicle projects. Some of
								my projects have included a neural network that can predict a song's genre and a
								cooperative autonomous vehicle system that includes an aerial drone and land robot working
								together to achieve a common goal. These projects, as well as some of the other cool stuff
								I've worked on, can be found on my
								<a href="https://github.com/shaye059" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I've
								also taught engineering skills such as coding and 3D printing to kids and adults.

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;">Music Genre Classification with a Neural Network</h2>
						<p> Myself and two others built and trained a neural network that could classify songs into 10
							different genres. As part of the project we tested a baseline which was trained on the basic
							waveform amplitude of the audio file, and compared it to a model trained on 5 specifically
							chosen features. Our baseline saw a 2x improvement over randomly guessing the genre and our
							feature trained model saw a 6x improvement.
							<br><br>
							The project was written in jupyter notebooks and our model was built using TensorFlow.
							More information about it is available
							<a href="https://github.com/shaye059/ML-Music-Genre-Classification" target="_blank">here</a>.

						</p>

						<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;"> Cooperative Autonomous System </h2>
						<p>The goal of this project was to have two autonomous vehicles - a land based robot and an air
							based drone - cooperate together autonomously to complete a task. The task chosen for our
							demonstration was garbage collection but the system could easily be adapted to other tasks
							such as cleaning up oil spills.
						<br>
						<br>
							The system implemented a Mask R-CNN neural network that detected litter in images. The image
							processing and path planning was done in Python. Most hardware components and sensors were
							programmed in C. You can learn more about this project
