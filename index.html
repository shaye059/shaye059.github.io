							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;">Bee Health Computer Vision: Varroa Mite Detection</h2>
						</a>
						<p> This project developed an AI-based solution for monitoring bee health, with a focus on
							distinguishing between bees and wasps and detecting varroa mites on bees. The initiative
							addressed the environmental challenge of maintaining healthy bee populations, given the
							detrimental impact of varroa mites.
							<br><br>
							A ResNet RS 350 model, fine-tuned on TensorFlow's bee_dataset, formed the core of this
							system. The model's capabilities were twofold: it differentiated between bees and wasps in
							images, and it identified varroa mites on bees. This distinction is crucial for beekeepers
							and environmentalists for effective bee population management and health monitoring.
							For deployment, the model was served using TensorFlow Serving within a Docker container,
							ensuring scalability and efficiency. The system architecture included a user-friendly
							frontend for image uploads and a backend server hosted on Cloud Run. This server managed
							request preprocessing and model prediction interactions.

							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;">Music Genre Classification with a Neural Network</h2>
						</a>
						<p> Myself and two others built and trained a neural network that could classify songs into 10
							different genres. As part of the project we tested a baseline which was trained on the basic
							waveform amplitude of the audio file, and compared it to a model trained on 5 specifically
							chosen features. Our baseline saw a 2x improvement over randomly guessing the genre and our
							feature trained model saw a <strong>6x improvement</strong>, with accuracy around 64% on
							average.
							<br><br>
							The neural network used was a <strong>multi-layer feed forward network</strong> that was
							built using <strong>Keras</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. Data was pulled from the
							<strong> <a href="http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html" target='_blank'>GTZAN
							</a></strong> dataset and was preprocessed into <strong>Excel</strong> using automated Python
							methods that we created. The entire project was written in a <strong>Jupyter Notebook
							</strong>. More information about it is available
							<a href="https://github.com/shaye059/ML-Music-Genre-Classification" target="_blank">here</a>.

							<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0em;"> Cooperative Autonomous System </h2>
						</a>
						<p>The goal of this project was to have two autonomous vehicles - a land based robot and an air
							based drone - cooperate together autonomously to complete a task. The task chosen for our
							demonstration was garbage collection but the system could easily be adapted to other tasks
							such as cleaning up oil spills.
						<br>
						<br>
							The system implemented a <strong>Mask R-CNN</strong> neural network that detected litter in
							images. The image processing and path planning was done in <strong>Python</strong> with
							<strong>OpenCV</strong> and <strong>NumPY</strong>. Most hardware components and sensors
							were programmed in <strong>C</strong>. The land based robot was powered by a <strong>Linux</strong>
							based RaspberryPi which also acted as an <strong>NGINX</strong> server for video streaming.
